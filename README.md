# My personal cheatsheets 
## This project contains cheat sheets of different languages, frameworks or libraries and their good practices

### SASS
Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
